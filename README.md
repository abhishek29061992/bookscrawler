# bookscrawler
A sample code in python that uses bottlenose, beautiful soup4, ezodf, lxml APIs to search and look up for product information on Amazon Store using the bottlenose API (a wrapper over Amazon Product Advertising API; https://github.com/lionheart/bottlenose). The search terms are looked up from a column in a .ods file (an open office spreadsheet) and required information from the Amazon Store is stored back in the same spreadsheet in other columns.
